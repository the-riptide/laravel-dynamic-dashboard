# laravel-dynamic-dashboard

## A quick and easy way to set up a dashboard for a project

This package was developed using the TALL stack. This means Laravel, Livewire, Alpine and Tailwind will need to be installed.

With this package, it becomes incredibly easy to set up most dashboards. There is no need to create dashboard views, controllers, models or migrations. All you need to do is set up one File and in there specify what types fields you'll require. The package will take care of the rest.

Note, this package is in Alpha. Documentation is sparse or non-existent. Many features are still being developed. Tests have also not been set up.

Also, instead of only one model being called to, say, show an article this package calls a seperate model for each field. This means it is unsuitable for high-traffic projects (though that might change at a future date).

I'll be sure to update this readme as we move forward, so check back often.
